# IST652-ScriptingforDataAnalysis-Spotify-Popularity

This is an analysis on a Kaggle Dataset called Spotify Audio Features, where I analyze the relationships between the included popularity score and the audio features to identify any common patterns. In addition, I webscrape Billboard's Hot 100 to validate the popularity score using the 100 most popular songs. Finally, I use five different classification methods to try and predict a track's popularity type. 


Two files are attached: a powerpoint presentation and Jupyter Notebook with programming script. 

IST_652_Scripting_for_Data_Analysis_Spotify_Popularity_Analysis.pptx file is a powerpoint summarizing Spotify Popularity Analysis. 

IST_652_Scripting_for_Data Analysis_Spotify_Popularity_Analysis.ipynb script is the program script created to implement analysis shared in the powerpoint deck.
